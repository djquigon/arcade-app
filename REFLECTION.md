# Reflection


## PARTIAL SUBMISSION 1 // TUE 2019-04-16 @ 11:55 PM EST

1. **DONE:** Created the Main Menu (MainMenu.java). Created two classes
    classes to represent the two games we chose to make: Tetris (TetrisStage.java) and
    Checkers (CheckersStage.java). Did some research on what different components we
    might need in order to make a game like Tetris.
    

2. **TODO:** Before the next deadline we plan to finish or have nearly finished Tetris.
    We have a few ideas as to what classes we'll need to make to do so.

3. **PROB:** At first we were having a hard time conceptualizing what class
    higherarchy we should have for Tetris, but after some research we think we
    have a better idea.
