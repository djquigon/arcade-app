# Reflection


## PARTIAL SUBMISSION 1 // TUE 2019-04-16 @ 11:55 PM EST

1. **DONE:** Created the Main Menu (MainMenu.java). Created two classes
    classes to represent the two games we chose to make: Tetris (TetrisStage.java) and
    Checkers (CheckersStage.java). Did some research on what different components we
    might need in order to make a game like Tetris.    

2. **TODO:** Before the next deadline we plan to finish or have nearly finished Tetris.
    We have a few ideas as to what classes we'll need to make to do so.

3. **PROB:** At first we were having a hard time conceptualizing what class
    higherarchy we should have for Tetris, but after some research we think we
    have a better idea.


## PARTIAL SUBMISSION 2 // TUE 2019-04-23 @ 11:55 PM EST

1. **DONE:** Board and layout of scene for Tetris made. L block movement and key actions tested.
    Checkers board and scene made. Began working on pieces to insert onto board.    

2. **TODO:** Most tetris pieces functioning on the board. Have checkers nearly complete.

3. **PROB:** Our approach for Tetris has encountered a few difficulties, specifically
    regarding our blocks and how they move through our 2d rectangle array. Will
    possibly consider other approaches.

    
## PARTIAL SUBMISSION 3 // TUE 2019-04-30 @ 11:55 PM EST

1. **DONE:** Majority of checkers done, only need to fix small bugs involving king piece functonality.    

2. **TODO:** Fix checkers bugs and make small improvements to UI, start on space invaders.

3. **PROB:** We've decided to scrap tetris due to difficulties with the board, we've agreed on
    replacing it with space invaders. Other than that, checkers was much easier.
    
## FINAL SUBMISSION // TUE 2019-05-07 @ 3:30 PM EST

1. **DONE:** Both games completed and functioning.    

2. **TODO:** Nothing, we are finished.

3. **PROB:** We came across some problems with space invaders, specifically with collisions, however
    we've solved all those problems now.
